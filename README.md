G-MAFIA BAT is an acronym for what are some of the worldâ€™s most powerful companies: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Apple, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.
Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than one received attention for their growing power and profits. As an investment strategy, do G-MAFIA BAT portfolios yield promising returns? What does correlation between these assets look like, whether positive or negative? Just how much did Amazon make over the past year and a half? I captured both exploratory data analysis and mean-variance optimization using Markowitz efficient frontier in a Jupyter notebook with LaTeX and Markdown. To visualize the efficient frontier, I used the CVXOPT package, which boils linear algebra, convex optimization, and quadratic programming down into convenient and consumable interfaces. To access financial data, I used stand-ins for the discontinued Yahoo Finance API, including pandas_datareader and yfinance. Visualizations are made with matplotlib and seaborn. Finally, I used the Sharpe ratio to arrive at an optimal portfolio recommendation and draw general conclusions.
